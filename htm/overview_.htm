<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The purpose of this document is to present an example of how to connect a serial communications device to the PAM module. In this example, we will be using the Outland Technology external Zoom Camera.  Serial devicea are usually connected to the accessory port and communicate with the ROV using the spare pair.  The drawback to that approach is that only one serial device can be connected to the ROV at a time.  The PAM allows multiple devices to be connected simultaneously by multiplexing serial data on the ROV comms bus.  Devices must be low bandwidth and not dependent on a specific timing sequence. Following is a list of items required to complete this setup.</p>
