<h1>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h1>

  <li><h3>What is the Zoom Camera?</h3>
  <p>The zoom camera is an externally mounted camera that provides zoom capabilities to the ROV.</p></li>

  <li><h3>Is this the only way to attach the Zoom Camera?</h3>
  <p>No. The normal connection for the Zoom Camera is to simply plug it directly into the ROV's accessory port and use the spare pair.  This document is provided as an example of a PAM configuration and may be useful for certain accessory configurations.</p></li>

  <li><h3>Are there any advantages to using the PAM to connect the Zoom Camera?</h3>
  <p>Without the PAM the zoom camera defaults to using the ROV's spare pair exclusively.  This prevents any other device from making use of the spare pair. By configuring the zoom camera through the PAM, we can free up the spare pair for other accessories that use it, such as a sonar accessory.</p></li>
